chip-io (0.5.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

 * Merged PR#70 to enable the underlying C code to be used properly in C based code
 * Updated README to add missing pins on the CHIP Pro that are available as GPIO
 * Updated README to denote pins that are available for Edge Detection

chip-io (0.5.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added 3 pins for the CHIP Pro as allowable for setting callbacks and edge
    detection to close out Issue #68

chip-io (0.5.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the I2S pins on the CHIP Pro as GPIO capable
  * Added per PWM/SoftPWM cleanup per Issue #64

chip-io (0.5.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix for Issue #63 where re-setting up a pin wasn't lining up with RPi.GPIO standards. Calling setup after the first time will now update direction.
  * README updates to point out the direction() function since that was missing

chip-io (0.5.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix for Issue #62 where using alternate name of an XIO would cause a segfault due to trying to set pull up/down resistor setting

chip-io (0.5.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-enabled the polarity setting for PWM based upon Issue #61
  * Fixed a 1 letter bug was trying to write inverted to polarity when it wants inversed (such facepalm)
  * Cleaned up the polarity setting code to work when PWM is not enabled
  * Fixed the unit test for pwm to verify we can set polarity

chip-io (0.5.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes to the PWM pytest
  * Added pytest for LRADC and Utilities
  * Makefile updates for all the things

chip-io (0.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updating Utilities to determine CHIP Pro better
  * Updating Utilities to only run CHIP appropriate code on the CHIP and not CHIP Pro
  * Updated README
